## [**4.0.2**] - 2024-02-26


### Changed

* Command updates now depend **not** on the environment (DEV/PROD), but on the environment variable (**DISABLE_UPDATE_COMMANDS**). This variable is *optional* and defaults to **false**, which enables command updates
* **Nodemon** has been replaced by **tsc-watch**
* All Embed components are now inherited from a shared instance that contains basic settings (color/timestamp/footer)

### Fixed

* Fixed an error when sending a join/leave message
* Fixed an error when the user was not assigned a role when logging in to the server 

## [**4.0.1**] - 2024-02-10

### Fixed

* Changed the logic of creating/deleting temporary voice channels to avoid crashes
* Fixed bugs in the music part of the bot, when a message was deleted when it did not exist, causing the bot to crash
