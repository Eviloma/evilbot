## About The Project

It features the following functionalities:

- **Music Playback**: The bot can play music using Lavalink. You can provide a track link or specify keywords for music search.
- **Welcome New Members**: Upon a new member joining the server, the bot can automatically greet them in a designated text channel with a welcome message.
- **Role Assignment on Entry**: The bot can assign a specific role to new members when they join the server.
- **Slash Commands**: The bot uses Discord Slash Commands for convenient interaction with users.
